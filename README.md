## Dependencies

* 100% Kotlin

## Marvel API KEY

In order to use this app you need to register on the Marvel Developer portal and create an api key.

If you already have an account you can check you api key and secret at https://developer.marvel.com/account.

Once you have both values, create a file called apikey.properties in the root directory with:

```
API_KEY="your api key"
API_SECRET="your api secret"
```

## Design Choises

* The base design was inspired by https://dribbble.com/shots/4985712-Marvel-Heroes-Library
* UI was not very well planned so it may look weird, this can be avoided hiring a designer :)

## TODOs

The app is not perfect and can be improved:

* Room for Database as local cache for Offline support
* Move strings from Layout to string.xml for localiztion
* Use transition shared elements to improve expirience when transition to characater details
* Add more tests :)
* Code organization probable can be improved too. The current organization may not scale well becuse we do not have a strong convention for package names.
